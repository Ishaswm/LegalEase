## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving messages**
   - Check webhook URL is correct
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled
   - Verify Twilio credentials

2. **PDF processing fails**
   - Ensure PDF contains readable text
   - Check file size (under 10MB)
   - Verify PDF is not password protected

3. **AI analysis not working**
   - Check Gemini API key is valid
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check application logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check logs
gcloud run services logs read lexi-simplify --region=us-central1 --limit=50

# Test API endpoints
curl -X POST https://your-app-url.run.app/whatsapp/webhook \
  -d "From=whatsapp:+1234567890" \
  -d "Body=help"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Security**: Implement Twilio signature validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Already implemented (50 requests per 5 minutes)
3. **Data Privacy**: Documents are temporarily stored and auto-deleted
4. **User Sessions**: Stored in memory, cleared automatically
